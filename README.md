# MongoDB: Empty $in Operator Issue

This repository demonstrates a common MongoDB query error involving the `$in` operator used with an empty array.  The provided JavaScript code snippet showcases the issue and its solution.

**Problem:** The query `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` returns no results, regardless of the presence of data. This is because an empty array within `$in` acts as a negation condition.

**Solution:**  Check for the emptiness of the array before executing the query, use an alternative approach or include additional criteria to ensure the query returns the expected results even when the array is empty.

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected approach.
